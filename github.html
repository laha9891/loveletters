	<p><h2>GitHub,</h2></p>

	<p>I think the time has come for me to be as <em class="pinktext">free  </em> as you. You’re always in the <em class="bluetext">same, exact place</em>, which is alright for a little while, but I want to save my files to other <em class="bluetext">repositories  </em> too.</p>

	<p>Yeah, sure you actually remembered my name, unlike Git, but you don’t know how to truly <em class="yellowtext">readme  </em> except for if I add a <em class="yellowtext">short description of my repository</em>. Other than the <em class="purpletext">commit -m (messages) I typed and saved</em> to you, you don’t really know me.</p>

	<p>Githubby, we had a great run, but it’s time for me to see other repositories and <em class="greentext">push</em> you away once and for all. And by “push you away”, I don’t mean that I won’t stop <em class="greentext">sending commits via git  </em> to you, but I hope we can just be friends from here on out.</p>

	<p><h3>Sorry,<br>
	Lauren</h3></p>
