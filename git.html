	<p><h2 class="container">Git,</h2></p>

	<p>I feel so gitty around you! From the moment you <em class="purpletext">created my first hidden .git folder</em>, my life has been better with you <em class="purpletext">init</em>. It’s so nice to always <em class="greentext">know where we are   </em> in our relationship with your <em class="greentext">status  </em> command as well.  Your <em class="orangetext">add  </em> command will also come in handy with <em class="orangetext">saving all of the html files  </em> and memories we will make over the years. Except my name... You never seem to remember <em class="bluetext">my name  </em> since I constantly have to remind you with <em class="bluetext">git config - -global user.name “URfirstname URlastname”  </em> and <em class="bluetext">git config - -global user.email “you@colorado.edu”</em>.</p>

	<p>I must say, the one thing that may lead to this relationship’s demise is when I get stuck in your commit message inferno. If Dante were still living, he would have definitely gone back and written this as the 10th circle of hell. Maybe you’re trying to get me more <em class="redtext">commit </em>ted to this relationship by forcing me to <em class="redtext">type the message</em> out before I forget, but seriously I’m not perfect.</p>

	<p>Despite this, I still like some your other features like when I get to <em class="turqtext">check(you)out  </em>  and you’re really good about getting me to <em class="yellowtext">branch</em> outside my comfort zones, aka the <em class="yellowtext">master branch</em>.</p>
