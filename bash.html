	<h2 class="container">Bash,</h2>
	<p>When you first stole me away from GUI, I must admit that I was a little hesitant at the beginning. You may not have the looks that Sublime had, but I shortly figured out that your appearance is easy to change to align with my Preferences. But I guess everyone goes through a GUI phase, and I shouldn’t just judge a shell by its boring background and text colors…</p>

	<p>Despite your looks though, you are much more useful than GUI, and I’ve learned so much from you. Your <em class="redtext">pwd  </em> command taught me to always live in the <em class="redtext">present (working directory)</em>. Your <em class="greentext">ls  </em> command taught me that it’s helpful to <em class="greentext">list everything that you have in the present (working directory)</em> so you don’t make a mistake. And your <em class="yellowtext">cd  </em> command taught me that it’s okay to <em class="yellowtext">change (directories)</em>. I also appreciate how <em  class="bluetext">open youAreWithMe.html  </em> !</p>

	<p>I think what was most <em class="purpletext">touch</em> ing though was when I realized you would do anything for me, like <em class="purpletext">creating files  </em> from the simplest commands. You <em class="orangetext">made a whole directory   </em>  for me with a mere <em class="orangetext">mkdir  </em> command. You remember <em class="pinktext">nano  </em> details, like when I <em class="pinktext">create and edit a html file</em>. I don’t even need a dog anymore because you will even <em class="turqtext">"fetch"   </em>  (files to a server) for me with the command <em class="turqtext">ssh </em>!</p>
